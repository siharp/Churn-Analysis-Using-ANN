# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Introductions
In this digital era, the telecommunication industry faces serious challenges in retaining their customers. One of the main problems faced by telecom service providers is churn, which is when a customer stops using their service and switches to another provider.

To overcome this problem, Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a tool to understand patterns and factors that influence customer churn. ANN is a machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of human neural networks. By using ANN, telecommunications companies can perform complex data analysis and predict potential churn with high accuracy.
